## 1. Project Description

This project aims to build a `WUDA Delivery` platform tailored for customers located within a `3-mile radius` of local shops and food vendors. The platform allows users to `browse` nearby grocery stores, restaurants, and small-scale food points, `view item details` including prices and availability, `add items` to a cart, and `place orders` for home delivery. Customers receive `live updates` on their order status—from confirmation to preparation and delivery—and can `track` the order and delivery agent’s.

To ensure quality and trust, customers are encouraged to leave `feedback and ratings` for each vendor, product, and delivery experience. This helps other users make informed decisions and motivates vendors and delivery personnel to maintain high service standards.

Vendors have access to a dedicated `dashboard` where they can manage their `inventory`, update product availability, set business hours, and view incoming orders. Delivery agents use a mobile interface to accept `delivery requests`, navigate to destinations, and update the order status at each step.

The platform emphasizes ease of use, responsiveness, and seamless interactions among all user types. Key non-functional goals include maintaining a fast user interface, ensuring high system availability, and reliability. The user experience is designed to be intuitive and efficient, even for individuals with limited digital literacy.

Overall, this system supports the growing demand for convenient, reliable, and locally focused delivery services, fostering stronger connections between neighborhood vendors and their surrounding communities.

## 2. Features

- **Customer Mobile Interface:**
  - Browse local vendors and food points.
  - Add items to the cart and place orders.
  - Real-time order tracking and delivery status updates.
  - Secure payment options and transaction management.
  - Ability to leave feedback and ratings for vendors, products, and delivery experiences.
- **Vendor Dashboard:**
  - Manage inventory and update product availability.
  - Set up a business profile and business hours.
  - Manage orders.
  - View and respond to customer feedback.
- **Delivery Agent Mobile Interface:**
  - Accept delivery requests and navigate to destinations.
  - Update order status at each step of the delivery process.

## Benefits

The platform supports the growing demand for convenient, reliable, and locally focused delivery services. It helps strengthen connections between neighborhood vendors and their surrounding communities by providing an efficient, trustworthy solution for local deliveries.

## 3. System Overview

We included the system's `Overview diagram` showing the system's end users. It shows that our system has different interfaces for end users, such as the `Customer Mobile App` for customers and the `vendor dashboard` for vendors. Then, it shows we have a common `API Gateway` for the whole system, allowing us to have a single point of entry to the system. It helps us interact with a distributed microservices backend. The system uses RESTful APIs for communication, enabling stateless and efficient data communication between the front and backend. The system also has three central databases to store its data.

## 4. Stakeholder Analysis

The following are the primary stakeholders for this hyperlocal delivery platform. Each stakeholder influences the system design based on their specific needs and expectations:

### Stakeholders

- **Customers**: End-users who browse, order, and receive products. Their satisfaction directly impacts platform adoption and success. A seamless and responsive user experience is critical.
- **Vendors**: Local shops and food vendors who list products and manage inventory. Vendor participation ensures a wide variety of offerings; they require a stable and reliable system to manage daily operations.
- **Delivery Agents**: Personnel responsible for picking up and delivering orders. Their efficiency affects order fulfillment speed and customer satisfaction; they need a simple and dependable app to manage deliveries.
- **Product Owner**: Oversees the platform’s strategic direction and growth. They are concerned with building a scalable system that can support future expansions without major redesigns.
- **Developers**: Technical team responsible for developing, maintaining, and improving the platform. They prioritize clean, maintainable code to ensure long-term system health and rapid feature updates.

### Negative Stakeholders

While our hyperlocal delivery platform provides value to customers, vendors, and delivery agents, certain stakeholders may oppose or be negatively impacted by the system. Identifying these groups helps mitigate risks and ensures smoother adoption.

- **Competing Delivery Platforms:** These established players may see our hyperlocal model as a threat, especially since we focus on small vendors within a 3-mile radius. They could respond by lowering fees, offering exclusive vendor contracts, or lobbying for regulations that disadvantage smaller platforms. This could limit our vendor partnerships and customer base.
- **Traditional Brick-and-Mortar Retailers (Not on the Platform):** Local stores that choose not to join our platform may lose business to competitors who offer delivery. They might discourage customers from using our service, form alliances to exclude us, or resist digital adoption, reducing the variety of vendors available on our system.
- **Neighborhood Residents (Non-Customers):** Increased delivery traffic (e.g., bikes, scooters) may cause noise, parking issues, or safety concerns in residential areas. Residents could complain to local officials, leading to delivery restrictions or negative publicity that harms our platform’s reputation.

## 7. Architectural Views

### <a id="7-1-context-viewpoint"></a> 7.1 Context Viewpoint

The `Context View` describes the `system’s boundaries` by showing its interactions with external actors such as users, vendors, delivery agents, and other systems. It highlights what is inside the system and what lies outside, helping stakeholders understand how the system fits into its environment and what major inputs and outputs exist.

The `Context Diagram` below shows how external entities, such as users and external systems, interact with our system. It shows that `vendors` provide their products and working hours information to our system, and the system provides customers with orders and business. The `customer` provides their delivery information and the products they added to the cart, and the system returns order confirmation and tracking of their orders. Similarly, the `delivery agent` receives the pending orders for delivery and completes the order delivery. Our system also interacts with external systems such as `Location API` (Google Maps) by providing the addresses and receiving the coordinates (longitude and latitude).

  <br>
  <em> Figure 2: Context view of the system showing the interaction of external entities with our system</em>
</div>

### <a id="7-2-use-case-viewpoint"></a> 7.2 Use Case Viewpoint

The Use Case Viewpoint captures the primary ways different users (customers, vendors, and delivery agents) interact with the delivery platform to achieve their goals. It outlines the major functionalities the system must support, such as browsing vendors, placing orders, tracking deliveries, managing inventory, and updating order statuses. This viewpoint helps in understanding user requirements clearly by focusing on user-system interactions and ensures that the system is designed around real-world activities and expectations of its stakeholders.

  <br>
  <em> Figure 3: Use case diagram demonstrating the use cases for vendor, customer and delivery agent</em>
</div>

### <a id="7-3-process-viewpoint"></a> 7.3 Process Viewpoint

The Process Viewpoint focuses on the system’s dynamic behavior and describes how different parts of the system interact at runtime to achieve specific tasks. It models processes such as order placement, payment handling, delivery tracking, and inventory updates, often showing how components communicate, synchronize, and handle concurrent activities. In this delivery platform, the process view ensures smooth coordination between customers, vendors, and delivery agents by managing workflows like order processing, delivery assignment, and real-time status updates.

The System Sequence Diagram (SSD) below outlines the step-by-step interactions between the key actors—Customer, Vendor, Delivery Agent—and the Hyperlocal Delivery Platform during an order's lifecycle. The process begins when the Customer browses nearby vendors, selects items, and confirms the order, prompting the System to process payment and notify the Vendor while assigning a Delivery Agent. Next, the Vendor updates inventory, confirms order acceptance, and marks it as ready for pickup, which triggers the System to alert the Delivery Agent and update the Customer on the order status. The Delivery Agent then accepts the request, picks up the order, and provides real-time updates as it moves through "En Route" to "Delivered," with the System relaying tracking information to the Customer. Finally, after delivery, the Customer submits feedback on the Vendor, products, and delivery experience, which the System records for analytics and service improvement. The diagram effectively captures the end-to-end workflow, highlighting real-time coordination, status updates, and seamless communication among all parties involved in the hyperlocal delivery process.

### <a id="7-4-development-viewpoint"></a> 7.4 Development Viewpoint

The Development View focuses on the system’s internal structure from a developer’s perspective. It describes how the software is organized in the codebase — such as modules, packages, layers, and components — and how they are built and managed. This view helps developers understand how to develop, maintain, and extend the system efficiently. It also covers aspects like version control, build processes, coding standards, and team organization.

  <em> Figure 5: Microservices diagram for hyperlocal delivery system</em>
</div>

### Architectural Component (microservices) Descriptions

**Product Service**\
The `Product Service` manages the product catalog and inventory, ensuring accurate stock levels and product details are available. It serves as the source of truth for product data, which other components like `Cart Service` rely on to display items and validate availability during checkout.

**Cart Service**\
The `Cart Service` handles all cart-related operations, such as adding or removing items, calculating totals, and applying discounts. It interacts with the `Product Service` to fetch real-time product details and passes finalized carts to the `Payment Service` for checkout.

**Order Service**\
The `Order Service` is responsible for managing the orders right from their creation to their fulfillment, including changing order status and order cancellation scenarios. It coordinates with the `Payment Service` for payment confirmation after the `Payment Service` completes transactions, and also interacts with the `Tracking Service` to monitor order status post-purchase and provide real-time tracking.

**Payment Service**\
The `Payment Service` manages all payment processing, including credit card transactions, digital wallets, and refunds. It ensures secure payment authorization and communicates success or failure back to the `Order Service`, which then updates the order status accordingly.

**Tracking Service**\
The `Tracking Service` monitors order fulfillment, providing real-time shipping and delivery status updates. It receives order data from the `Order Service`, tracks and delivers products, and notifies customers of progress.

**Feedback Service**\
The `Feedback Service` collects and processes customer reviews and ratings linked to orders. This feedback information is required for the `Product Service` to create the product listing. It also aggregates feedback for analytics, which the `Business Profile Service` uses to generate vendor performance reports and improve service quality.

**Business Profile Service**\
The `Business Profile Service` manages vendor profiles, store settings, and business analytics. The vendor profiles also include the product listing, which includes product information, customer reviews, and feedback. It compiles data from orders, payments, and feedback services to provide insights into sales performance, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency.

## 8. Usability Viewpoint

We provided mid-fidelity designs to address the usability concerns of end users and to showcase how our system is designed to meet the expectations of users across various devices, including iOS, Android, and the web. This approach allows us to highlight our key architectural decisions aimed at enhancing the user experience. The diagrams illustrate that our design adheres to modern UI/UX principles.

We have adopted a minimalistic design to ensure that our system is easy to use and understand. Additionally, we have created separate user interfaces tailored for different users, including distinct mobile applications for customers and delivery agents, as well as a web dashboard for vendors. This minimalistic approach and the separation of user interfaces contribute to improving the overall understandability of our system, which is an essential aspect of usability.

## 9. Architectural Patterns Used in the Project

### <a id="9-1-microservices-architecture"></a> 9.1 Microservices Architecture

Our system follows a microservices architecture style compared to a monolithic architecture, and we have a total of seven microservices. The three clients, 1) the Customer mobile app, 2) the Vendor dashboard, and 3) the Delivery agent mobile app, interact with the backend microservices through an API gateway. This interaction is stateless using RESTful APIs, and the communication between these microservices and the clients is through the JSON data format. Figure 5 shows the microservices architecture style of our system.

**Quality attributes**: Availability, scalability, and maintainability.

### <a id="9-2-model-view-controller-mvc-pattern"></a> 9.2 Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern

We have used Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture patterns, which separate a system into three distinct components: the Model, which manages data logic; the View, which handles presentation and user interface; and the Controller, which processes input, invokes Model operations, and updates the View. This separation promotes modularity, ease of maintenance, and testability. By isolating business rules from the user interface, developers can work on different components simultaneously without introducing side effects. In server-side frameworks like Laravel, MVC enables clean, organized codebases where models represent database entities, views are templated frontends, and controllers serve as the business logic part.

Figure 10 illustrates the application of the MVC pattern in our system architecture, demonstrated through the interaction between the Product Service and the customer mobile app. The implementation follows these key flows:

When a customer views product information through the mobile app (which serves as the View layer), the app initiates a request to fetch product data via RESTful APIs exposed by the `Product Service`. This request is first received by the `Products Controller`, which acts as the intermediary between the View and data operations.

The `Product Controller` performs several critical functions: it validates the incoming request, processes any required business logic, and coordinates with the `Product Model` to retrieve the necessary data. The `Product Model`, representing the data layer, executes the actual data retrieval operations based on the Controller's instructions, typically involving querying the database or other persistence mechanisms.

Upon receiving the requested data from the `Product Model`, the `Product Controller` formats and returns the appropriate response to the mobile app View, completing the cycle. This separation of concerns ensures that the View remains focused on presentation, the Controller handles user input and application flow, while the Model manages data access and retrieval.

**Quality attributes**: Maintainability.

### <a id="9-3-restful-api-pattern"></a> 9.3 REST architecture pattern

We also used the REST API architectural pattern, which is based on stateless communication and resource-based interactions over HTTP. It structures requests around CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on resources, using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and returning lightweight JSON payloads. RESTful APIs enable decoupling between frontend clients and backend services, allowing independent evolution of both layers. To enhance scalability, security, and maintainability, an API Gateway can be introduced. The API Gateway acts as a single entry point for all client requests, managing authentication, request routing, rate limiting, and aggregating responses from multiple microservices. This pattern simplifies client-side logic, ensures consistent cross-cutting concerns, and enables backend services to remain focused on business logic. In a microservices architecture, the combination of REST APIs and an API Gateway streamlines communication, enhances system resilience, and supports horizontal scaling.

**Quality attributes**: Scalability and simplicity.

## 10. Key Architectural Decisions to Address Quality Attributes

### <a id="10-1-component-based-spa-architecture"></a> 10.1 Component-based SPA Architecture

- **Issue**: Traditional multi-page applications cause reloads that interrupt workflows.
- **Rationale**: Single Page Applications (SPA) provide seamless navigation and faster interactions, crucial for vendor dashboards. Component-based design ensures consistency and reusability across the app.
- **Benefits**: Smooth user experience with no full-page reloads; consistent design language throughout the app.
- **Limitations**: Requires more complex client-side state management (e.g., Redux) and might affect initial load time.
- **Quality attributes**: Usability and performance.
- **Alternative Solutions**: Use server-side rendering (SSR) frameworks like **Next.js** to balance performance and interactivity.
- **Summary**: We chose SPA with React for its seamless UX and performance. SSR was considered but offers less client-side interactivity.

### <a id="10-2-minimalist-modern-design"></a> 10.2 Minimalist Modern Design

- **Limitations**: May encounter limitations in accessing low-level native APIs; requires bridging in some cases.
- **Quality attributes**: Scalability, maintianability.
- **Alternative Solutions**: Use **Flutter** for high-performance cross-platform development or native development for full control.
- **Summary**: React Native chosen for its balance of cost, performance, and developer familiarity; Flutter or native could add overhead.

### <a id="10-4-microservices-with-rest-json"></a> 10.4 Microservices with REST/JSON

- **Issue**: Monolithic architectures limit scalability and can become performance bottlenecks.
- **Rationale**: Microservices allow scaling of individual components, and REST/JSON offers lightweight communication.
- **Benefits**: Independent scaling, improved fault isolation, reduced data transfer size.
- **Limitations**: Increased complexity in managing service boundaries and deployments.
- **Quality attributes**: Performance, scalability.
- **Alternative Solutions**: Use **GraphQL** to optimize API communication or **gRPC** for higher performance.
- **Summary**: REST/JSON was selected for simplicity and wide compatibility; GraphQL or gRPC were considered but are heavier solutions.

### <a id="10-5-sqlite-local-storage"></a> 10.5 SQLite Local Storage

- **Issue**: Frequent API calls for product data increase load times and data usage.
- **Rationale**: Local storage caches frequently accessed data, reducing API calls and enabling offline access.
- **Benefits**: Improved load times, reduced mobile data usage, offline functionality.
- **Limitations**: Risk of stale data if synchronization is not managed properly.
- **Quality attributes**: Performance.
- **Alternative Solutions**: Use **AsynStorage** or **Realm DB (for mobile)** for more advanced local data management.
- **Summary**: SQLite was chosen for simplicity; Realm offer more features but add complexity.

### <a id="10-6-kubernetes-orchestration"></a> 10.6 Kubernetes Orchestration

- **Issue**: High-availability requirements for backend services under dynamic loads.
- **Rationale**: Kubernetes provides automated deployment, scaling, and self-healing capabilities.
- **Benefits**: High availability, automatic scaling, fault tolerance, and load balancing.
- **Limitations**: Steep learning curve, additional overhead for managing Kubernetes clusters.
- **Quality attributes**: Performance, availability.
- **Alternative Solutions**: Use **serverless architectures** (e.g., AWS Lambda) or **Docker Swarm**.
- **Summary**: Kubernetes was chosen for robust orchestration; simpler alternatives were considered but lacked required capabilities.

### <a id="10-7-lazy-loading"></a> 10.7 Lazy Loading

- **Issue**: Loading all resources upfront increases initial page load time.
- **Rationale**: Lazy loading defers non-critical resources, improving perceived performance.
- **Benefits**: Faster initial page loads, reduced server bandwidth.
- **Limitations**: Possible delays in loading deferred resources when needed.
- **Quality attributes**: Performance.
- **Alternative Solutions**: Implement **critical resources** and prioritized loading, or use **CDN edge caching**.
- **Summary**: Lazy loading provides direct benefits with minimal complexity; CDN strategies are good but secondary.

### <a id="10-8-multi-db-deployment"></a> 10.8 Multi-DB Deployment

- **Issue**: A Single database failure can cause downtime.
- **Rationale**: Active-active replication distributes load and ensures failover capabilities.
- **Benefits**: High availability, resilience to regional failures, and distributed reads.
- **Limitations**: Increased complexity in replication and consistency management.
- **Quality attributes**: Availability.
- **Alternative Solutions**: Use managed distributed databases like **Amazon Aurora Global** or **Google Cloud Spanner**.
- **Summary**: Multi-DB replication was chosen for control and resilience; managed solutions were considered, but they add vendor lock-in.

### <a id="10-9-microservices-isolation"></a> 10.9 Microservices Isolation

- **Issue**: Failures in one part of the system can cascade and affect the entire system.
- **Rationale**: Isolating services ensures faults remain contained.
- **Benefits**: One service failure (e.g., payments) does not affect others (e.g., product catalog).
- **Limitations**: Requires robust inter-service communication and monitoring.
- **Quality attributes**: Availability.
- **Alternative Solutions**: Use **modular monolith**.
- **Summary**: Service isolation chosen for clear fault boundaries; modular monolith is simpler but less scalable.

### <a id="10-10-horizontal-microservices-scaling"></a> 10.10 Horizontal Microservices Scaling

- **Issue**: Sudden increases in load can overwhelm services.
- **Rationale**: Horizontal scaling adds instances of services under load.
- **Benefits**: Scalability with predictable performance.
- **Limitations**: Requires effective load balancing and monitoring.
- **Quality attributes**: Scalability.
- **Alternative Solutions**: Use **serverless functions** for automatic scaling without managing infrastructure.
- **Summary**: Horizontal scaling offers predictable control; serverless functions were considered but have cold start penalties.

### <a id="10-11-stateless-apis"></a> 10.11 Stateless APIs

- **Issue**: Stateful APIs complicate scaling due to session management.
- **Rationale**: Stateless APIs simplify scaling and load balancing by removing session dependency.
- **Benefits**: Easy horizontal scaling, reduced complexity.
- **Limitations**: Requires external session management (e.g., Redis) if needed.
- **Quality attributes**: Scalability.
- **Alternative Solutions**: Use **web sockets**.
- **Summary**: Stateless APIs are chosen for their simplicity; web sockets add complexity and are suitable for real-time applications.

### <a id="10-12-mvc-with-orm"></a> 10.12 MVC (Model View Controller) with ORM (Object Relational Mapper)

- **Issue**: Coupled business logic and presentation layers increase complexity and maintenance costs.
- **Rationale**: MVC separates concerns, and ORM reduces boilerplate while managing database interactions.
- **Benefits**: Clean code structure, reduced development overhead, version-controlled schema changes.
- **Limitations**: ORM can introduce performance overhead for complex queries.
- **Quality attributes**: Maintainability.
- **Alternative Solutions**: Use MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) or **micro-ORMs like Dapper** or raw SQL for performance-critical parts.
- **Summary**: MVC with ORM was chosen for its maintainability; MVVM, micro-ORMs/raw SQL are alternatives but increase manual work.

### <a id="10-13-react-native-unified-codebase"></a> 10.13 React Native Unified Codebase

- **Issue**: Maintaining separate iOS and Android codebases leads to duplication of work.
- **Rationale**: React Native allows sharing most of the code, reducing maintenance and delivery effort.
- **Benefits**: Single codebase, faster bug fixes, unified CI/CD pipeline.
- **Limitations**: Limited access to certain native modules, may need custom bridging.
- **Quality attributes**: Maintainability.
- **Alternative Solutions**: Use **Flutter** for even more unified code or **native development** for full control.
- **Summary**: React Native chosen for simplicity and shared code; Flutter and native were considered but add complexity.

## 11. Relationship between identified architecture design decisions

  <em> Figure 11: Relationship between key architectural decisions.</em>
</div>
We have provided the alternate competing solutions and the relationships between the key architectural decisions in Figure 12. This diagram is drawn to show the architectural decisions in the design space tree diagram. This diagram shows that the architectural decisions are not independent but are related to each other. Below, we provide a few examples to explain this:

#### Relationship between microservices architecture, API Gateway, and RESTful APIs

- We chose to use the microservices architectural style, and because of this decision, we also had to decide how to handle data communication and access to the microservices.
- Without microservices, a monolithic architecture might have used direct method calls or a shared database, making RESTful APIs and an API Gateway unnecessary.
- Therefore, we decided to use RESTful APIs for communication over HTTP(s) and adopted an API Gateway as the single entry point to backend microservices.

#### Relationship between microservices and container orchestration and scaling

- Since we are using microservices, which are deployed as independent containers, we need to decide how to manage these containers at scale.
- Without microservices, container orchestration tools like Kubernetes would be irrelevant (e.g., a monolithic app could run on a single server).
- Thus, we decided to use Kubernetes for orchestration and horizontal scaling to manage microservices efficiently.

#### Relationship between separate UIs and technology-specific decisions

- The decision to have separate user interfaces for different users required us to select appropriate technologies for each frontend.
- If we had a single UI, React.js for a web dashboard and React Native for mobile apps would not be needed—a single framework would be enough.
- As a result, we chose: Component-based SPA (React.js) for the web dashboard, React Native for cross-platform mobile apps (customer/delivery agent).

#### Relationship between the React Native mobile apps and SQLite for offline persistence

- Because we chose React Native for mobile apps, we needed local data storage, leading to the decision to use SQLite.
- Without React Native (e.g., if we used a pure web app), SQLite would be irrelevant—alternatives like IndexedDB (web) might apply.
